This project attempts to offer a very fast pseudo random number
generator with normal distributed values.

 +++ DESIGN +++

In 1995, Fernandez and Rivero proposed a fast method to generate
normal distributed pseudo random numbers. Since the sinus and cosinus
functions are only used for initialization, it should be faster than
the generally used Box-Muller method, but tests are pending.

The Fernandez-Rivero method uses pre-calculated angles by which pre-
calculated normal distributed random numbers (interpreted as two-
dimensional coordinates) are rotated. For a in-depth explanation of
the algorithm, please refer to the corresponding article. 

The algorithm is implemented as a single C function which in turn is
wrapped by several other functions and should always be kept opaque
itself.  As a consequence, the opaque function is not included in the
header file.

To assert a maximal optimization, several parameters are set at
compile time. Also all uniform distributed pseudo random numbers
are generated by a hash function.

 +++ GOALS +++

The goal is it to provide a very fast normal distributed pseudo
random number generator. Several milestones are yet to be achieved:

- Proof of correctness
- Thread safety
- Comparison to other methods
- Better build options / configurability

 +++ ISSUES +++

- The thread safety is not given.
- Some magic numbers appear in the code.
- Hashes are no random numbers.

 +++ DOCUMENTATION +++

The documentation is inline only. Please refer to the nrand.h for
usage, the test.c for examples and the nrand.c for in-depth
documentation of the implementation.

 +++ BUILDING +++

Use 'make' to build the object file. Builds have been tested under
Darwin, Linux and Windows with Cygwin installed. A standard GNU C
compiler suite is expected.

Use 'make test' to build a test executable, which makes a speed and
accuracy test.
